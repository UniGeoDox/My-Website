## Hello World!

Hello and welcome to my blog! My name is Donald Clark and I am an aspiring IT systems administrator.  I wanted to start by building out a website to catalog some of the fun and interesting (at least to me) projects that I work on time to time.  I also don’t love any individual platforms abilities as far as posting goes so donald.click is born.

I will likely post monthly showing off anything interesting I have done recently.  Topics and projects may vary widely as I like to let creativity flow in many directions at once to pick up that sweet, sweet, basic knowledge.  As I try new hobbies some stick into long term projects and some fail until another day.   Any project updates may eventually be sorted into topics but currently will be organized chronologically. This first post is a breakdown of 

I had to start with getting some basic dev tools. I first got npm installed as well as a set up a new GitHub repository. Then I went ahead and got Astro/Tailwind combo implemented into VS Code and read up a little bit on TypeScript as well reviewed some of my old BitBurner scripts. Sweet game that, recommend you check it out.  After that I was off to the races. 

The framework I’m using for this site is Astro, with Tailwind CSS. This setup let me skip a lot of traditional HTML and CSS boilerplate and jump straight into building components with TypeScript, which was a huge plus since I already had some hands-on experience with it from the game BitBurner.  Anyway Astro’s component-based system made it easy to structure the site cleanly. I then used Vercel to handle deployments, builds, and SSL automatically in the background. Most of the code came together through a mix of trial and error, YouTube tutorials, and the occasional assist from your favorite LLM. By leaning on utility-first styling with Tailwind and Astro’s layout system, I was able to create quickly and focus on structure, style and readability instead of fighting CSS.

I started first with the directory frameworks. Keeping things organized in projects has been something I picked up while developing little games in Unity and Godot. I figure keeping most files organized would help with debug later but to be honest I didn’t even need it.  Even as I added more and more components to the site something that didn’t feel at all like Unity or Godot was the fact that new stuff didn’t break the old. Most debug was done in the VSCode directly when errors occurred and using the integrated (your favorite LLM) to look up proper syntax. I was able to slowly begin creating the style of global style of the site. This global CSS allowed me to use the aforementioned component-based system to create reusable segments which meant once the homepage felt complete, the rest of the site was going to fall much faster.  Re-usability for the win! 

The blog section of the site was the most interesting for me to design. I wanted the ability to store posts for queue and I was able to implement a handy little hiding function that allows me to pre-post blogs if needed. It works by checking today’s date daily 12:00 noon and if any post exists in the content blog that has a date code before that moment, it automatically gets revealed on the site! To add new posts I still have to push new changes via Vercel but it means I can stockpile changes if needed! 

Anyways on to my next project. I think I am going to begin working on an Amiibo card hack so stay tuned for that! 

Goodbye world!
 

Hello and welcome to my blog! My name is Donald Clark, and I am an aspiring IT systems administrator with a growing interest in how software, infrastructure, and tooling all fit together. I decided to build this website as a place to document projects I’m working on, experiments I’m running, and things I’m learning along the way. Rather than relying entirely on a single platform, I wanted something I owned end‑to‑end, from the code to the deployment. That decision is what led to the creation of donald.click.
I plan to post on a roughly monthly basis, highlighting anything interesting I’ve worked on recently. Topics will likely vary, as I tend to explore multiple areas at once when I’m gaining that sweet, sweet knowledge. As I try new hobbies some stick into long term projects and some fail until another day.   Any project updates may eventually be sorted into topics but currently will be organized chronologically.  (spoilers maybe?)This first post serves as an introduction, as well as a high‑level breakdown of how the site itself is built.
To get started, I set up a basic development environment. This included installing Node.js and npm for dependency management, creating a new GitHub repository for version control, and configuring my editor (VS Code) for web development. From there, I initialized the project using Astro and Tailwind CSS, and refreshed my familiarity with TypeScript by revisiting some older scripts I had written while playing the programming game BitBurner.
The framework powering this site is Astro, paired with Tailwind CSS for styling. Astro allows pages to be composed from reusable components while shipping minimal JavaScript to the browser by default, which keeps the site fast and lightweight. While the site still uses standard HTML and CSS under the hood, Astro’s component model and build process reduce boilerplate and make the structure easier to reason about. Tailwind’s utility‑first approach made it easy to iterate on layout and styling directly in markup without constantly switching contexts. For hosting and deployment, I’m using Vercel, which handles builds, deployments, and HTTPS automatically whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
One of the first things I focused on was organizing the project’s directory structure. This is a habit I picked up from working with game engines like Unity and Godot, where keeping assets and logic clearly separated becomes essential as projects grow. In Astro, this meant keeping components, layouts, and content organized from the beginning. As the site expanded, I found that adding new pages or components rarely affected existing ones, which made iteration much smoother. Most debugging was handled directly in VS Code using compiler errors, logs, and documentation, with occasional help from an LLM to confirm syntax or clarify concepts.
The blog system itself ended up being one of the more interesting parts to design. Posts are stored as content files, and each includes metadata such as a publication date. During the build process, the site checks this date against the current time and only renders posts that are scheduled to be public. This allows me to write and commit posts ahead of time while controlling when they appear on the site. New content still requires a push to the repository, but the scheduling logic means posts can be prepared in advance without additional manual changes.
This site is very much a work in progress, but it already serves its main purpose: giving me a space to learn in public and document my growth. Up next, I’m planning to experiment with an Amiibo card project, which should involve a mix of hardware tinkering and software tooling. I’ll be documenting that here as well.
Goodbye!
