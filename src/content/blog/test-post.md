## Why I’m starting this blog

I’m building my way into IT by studying for CompTIA A+ and getting hands-on with real troubleshooting.
This blog is where I’ll document fixes, lessons learned, and projects so employers (and future me) can see proof of work.

### What I’m working on right now
- CompTIA A+ (Core 1 + Core 2)
- Home lab basics (Windows installs, drivers, BIOS/UEFI, networking fundamentals)
- Documenting troubleshooting steps clearly

### What’s next
- Network+ after A+
- More structured “problem → diagnosis → fix” posts
- A resume page and contact page on this site
